Here’s a recommended setup for your new GitHub repository, tailored for your advanced data analyst preparation and interview mastery:

---

**Repository Name:**  
`data-analyst-interview-university`

**Description:**  
A structured 45-day roadmap and resource hub to master Data Analyst interviews. Includes resume-based Q&A, advanced SQL/statistics/viz resources, project templates, and progress tracking—modeled after Coding Interview University and tailored to my experience.

**Visibility:**  
Public (recommended for recruiters and sharing).

**Initialize with:**  
- Add a README file (use the custom README I provided above)
- Add a .gitignore (choose “Python,” and add “JupyterNotebooks” if you’ll have notebooks)
- Choose a license (MIT or Apache 2.0 are open and recruiter-friendly)

---

### What to do after repo creation:

1. **Paste the README**
   - Use the detailed README (structured plan, Q&A, project links, etc.) I created for you above.
2. **Upload your resume image**
   - Add your resume image (the one you uploaded, e.g., `resume.png`) for easy reference.
3. **Create folders for:**
   - `/projects` (put your project code, dashboards, notebooks)
   - `/notes` (interview Q&A, SQL/Stats notes, links)
   - `/progress` (track daily/weekly checklist)
