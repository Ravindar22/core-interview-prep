### **Projects**

#### **Smart Traffic Control System (LabVIEW & Arduino)**
- **Q: What was the biggest challenge in this project?**  
  **A:** Integrating hardware and software for real-time simulation was challenging. I overcame it by iterative testing and modular coding, achieving 100% timing accuracy.

- **Q: How does this project demonstrate your engineering skills?**  
  **A:** It showcases my ability to interface hardware and software, design automated logic, and build functional prototypes‚Äîall vital for modern industrial automation.

---

### **Relevant Coursework**
- **Q: How have you applied Lean Manufacturing or Six Sigma in your experience?**  
  **A:** At AgGBPS, I used Lean and 5S methodologies to improve plant efficiency. I identified waste, streamlined maintenance, and improved process flow.

- **Q: What is Statistical Quality Control and why is it important?**  
  **A:** SQC uses data/statistics to monitor and improve manufacturing quality. It helps detect defects, control variability, and ensure consistent output.

---

### **Skills & Technical Questions**

- **Q: How do you use technical tools like AutoCAD, SolidWorks, or Creo?**  
  **A:** I use these tools for CAD modeling, production drawings, and process layouts. In my projects, I designed component layouts and production workflows to optimize material flow.

- **Q: What is the significance of Production Planning & Control (PPC)?**  
  **A:** PPC ensures resources are optimized, schedules are met, and production targets are achieved. It minimizes downtime and aligns production with demand.

- **Q: Explain a time you used MS Excel for engineering analysis.**  
  **A:** I used Excel to analyze process data, track maintenance schedules, and visualize trends. For example, I plotted tool wear vs. production output to optimize changeover times.

---

### **Behavioral/HR Questions**

- **Q: Describe a time you worked in a team to solve a problem.**  
  **A:** During my internship, I coordinated with operators and the maintenance team to address recurring breakdowns. By fostering open communication and sharing ideas, we implemented preventive measures that reduced downtime.

- **Q: How do you handle pressure or tight deadlines?**  
  **A:** I prioritize tasks, break down problems, and stay focused on solutions. Sports have taught me discipline and staying calm under pressure, which I apply in professional scenarios.

- **Q: What motivates you to pursue a core engineering career?**  
  **A:** I am passionate about solving real-world problems, optimizing processes, and contributing to large-scale industrial systems.
